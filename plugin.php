Version: 1.0.5
Author: Mark O'Sullivan
Author URI: http://www.vanillaforums.org/

ChangeLog:
1.0.4
- Fixed validation of Vanilla Url to correct when users incorrectly enter the path to their discussion instead of the actual root of the forum.
- Fixed a bug that caused Vanilla Admin JS & CSS to be included on all wp dashboard pages.
- Fixed a bug that caused the copy of the embed template to fail and throw a fatal PHP error.
- Added an option to the embed form that allows widgets to use the embed url instead of the actual forum url.
- Changed discussions widget to friendly-url-encode discussion titles.
- Fixed plugin to work with forums that are not using mod_rewrite.
1.0.5
- Fixed css & js includes so the containing folder is no longer hard-coded.
- Added css file so Vanilla icon displays on all admin pages (not just when looking at a vanilla page).
